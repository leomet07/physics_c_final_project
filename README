#Our project is a simulation of a bike rolling along the x-axis of a flat plane. 
#There are two graphs, one that plots the x position of the bike’s center of 
#mass and one that plots the x velocity of the bike’s center of mass. 

#The user can tell if a wheel is locked (and sliding) based on its color: wheels 
#will turn red when they start to slide. They can also tell visually if the bike
#is flipping.

#The user can control several variables:

#First, there are two sliders that control the coefficients of static and 
#kinetic friction. Both are important, because static friction determines when 
#the bike’s wheels start sliding and kinetic friction determines how quickly the 
#bike slows down once its wheels are sliding. 

#There is also a slider to control the bike’s center of mass. Moving the center 
#of mass backward simulates the rider leaning back in their seat. It should be 
#noted that moving the slider right actually moves the center of mass to the left.

#Braking force and activation time for the front and back wheels of the bike can 
#be controlled by pressing f and b respectively. Pressing f delivers an impulse 
#to the front wheel, while pressing b delivers an impulse to the back wheel. 
#These impulses last 0.25 seconds and can be stacked on top of each other (ie. 
#pressing f repeatedly will increase the braking force applied to the front 
#wheel). Initially, we said we would use functions and sliders to control these 
#variables, but we simplified this to pressing buttons per Ms. Sharaf’s 
#suggestion after we had submitted the final project proposal.
